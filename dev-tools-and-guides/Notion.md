## Introduction
Notion can be your to-do list, kanban tool, documentation tool, note-taking tool, web clipper, or even your team management tool. It can also be your web page builder or community sharing tool. The original meaning of the English word "Notion" is a sudden idea or concept. Maybe that's what the developers wanted to give you—a concept you can shape into your own powerful tool as you see fit.

## AI Features
Now built-in with AI features, you can use it for anything! For example: writing articles, rewriting, brainstorming, continuing writing, translating, summarizing, modifying sentences, coding, explaining terms, etc. In short, make the most of this tool to boost your productivity.

## Difference from ChatGPT
Notion and ChatGPT are two completely different tools. Notion is a team collaboration tool for managing projects, tasks, files, etc., and can also be used for note-taking and writing. ChatGPT is an AI-based natural language processing tool for generating natural language text, such as answering questions, writing essays, etc. Therefore, their use cases and functions are completely different.
